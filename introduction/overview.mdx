# What is InsureAI?

InsureAI is a conversational AI assistant purpose-built for insurance customer support. It uses a **multi-agent architecture** powered by [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) to route customer queries to specialized domain agents — each with access to the right tools, data, and security context.
