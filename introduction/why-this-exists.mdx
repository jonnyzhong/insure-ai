# Why InsureAI Exists

## The Problem

Insurance customer support faces several persistent challenges:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High Volume, Repetitive Queries">
    80% of customer inquiries are routine: "What's my policy status?", "When is my bill due?", "How do I file a claim?" These don't require human expertise but still consume agent time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Domain Complexity">
    Insurance involves multiple domains — policies, billing, claims, vehicles, regulations. A single human agent must context-switch between all of these, leading to longer handle times and errors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Security Concerns">
    Customers should only access their own data. Traditional chatbots often lack fine-grained access control at the data layer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Limited Self-Service">
    Customers can't generate consolidated views of their insurance portfolio without calling support and waiting for manual reports.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Solution

InsureAI addresses each of these problems with a **multi-agent architecture**:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Repetitive queries | Automated agents handle routine questions 24/7 |
| Domain complexity | Five specialist agents, each expert in one domain |
| Data security | Three-layer guardrail + tool-level ownership checks |
| Limited self-service | One-click Executive Summary Report with AI narrative |

## Why Multi-Agent?

A single monolithic LLM chatbot struggles with:

- **Tool overload** — Too many tools confuse the model's tool selection
- **Prompt bloat** — Domain-specific instructions for 5 areas make prompts unwieldy
- **Error isolation** — A billing bug shouldn't affect claims handling

The **supervisor pattern** solves this by:

1. Keeping the routing decision simple (one LLM call with structured output)
2. Giving each agent only the tools it needs
3. Isolating domain logic into separate nodes

## Why Singapore?

The application is contextualized for the Singapore insurance market with:

- **NCD** (No-Claim Discount) — up to 50% for private cars
- **COE** (Certificate of Entitlement) — affects vehicle insurance premiums
- **GIRO** — automated bank payment method for premiums
- **PayNow** — instant funds transfer for claims and payments
- **MAS** — Monetary Authority of Singapore regulatory references
- **Singapore-specific data** — NRIC format, postal codes, HDB addresses, regional distribution
