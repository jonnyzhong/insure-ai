Generate a professional production-grade README.md for GitHub.
First analyze the repository structure and infer the purpose of each module from the code.
Then write the README so that a new developer can immediately understand:

Based on this repository source code and folder structure, generate a professional GitHub README.md following best practices.
The README must be accurate to the actual codebase (do not guess features that do not exist).
Include these sections:
Project Title
Project Overview (what this project does, business purpose, use case,what problem it solves, how the architecture works)
Add a high-level architecture diagram using Mermaid if possible.
Use bullet points, tables, and code blocks where useful.
Key Features (based on code)
Tech Stack / Dependencies
Repository Structure (tree-style explanation)
Component Breakdown (explain each main module/folder and what it does)
Installation / Setup Guide (step-by-step)
How to Run (local run commands)
Configuration (env variables, config files)
Example Usage (API calls / sample workflow if applicable)
Output / Expected Results
Testing (if any)
Deployment (if applicable)
Troubleshooting / Common Issues
Roadmap / Future Improvements (if any)
Contribution Guidelines
License

Important constraints:
Use clear markdown formatting.
Add badges (build, license, python/node version) only if relevant.
If something is missing (example: no tests), clearly mention "Not available yet".
Keep tone professional and publish-ready.
Make it easy for a new developer to understand and start within 5 minutes.
✅ "Do not hallucinate"
✅ "If unsure, mark as TBD"
✅ "Base on actual folder structure"
Output only the final README.md content.
